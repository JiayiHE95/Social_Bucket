# Social Bucket, the future of social media

## Versions

I used:

Java 11 (any version above 11 should work)
Apache Maven 3.6.3

to install maven on ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install maven
```
## How to run

Make sure you have your postgresql database running on port 5432.
**MAKE SURE THE CONFIGS ARE CORRECT IN THE CODE FOR DATABASE CONNECTION.**

To run the application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```
